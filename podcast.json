There are just so many parts that you have to implement before you even get to a decent prototype, and so many hours of work before you could begin working on the ideas that would make your database unique. Apache DataFusion is a project that hopes to change all that, but building an extensible, composable toolkit of database pieces, which could let you build a viable database extremely quickly, and then innovate from that starting point. And even if you’re not building a database, it’s a fascinating project to explain how databases are built.</p><p>Joining me to explain it all is Andrew Lamb, one of DataFusion’s core contributors, and he’s going to take us through the whole stack, how it’s built and how you could use it. Along the way we cover everything from who’s building interesting new databases and how you manage a large, open-source Rust project.</p><p>–</p><p>DataFusion Homepage: <a href=\"https://datafusion.apache.org/\">https://datafusion.apache.org/</a></p><p>DataFusion on Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/datafusion\">https://github.com/apache/datafusion</a></p><p>DataFusion Architecture (with diagrams!): <a href=\"https://youtu.be/NVKujPxwSBA?si=tw9ACxlbdpBuVsnv&amp;t=1045\">https://youtu.be/NVKujPxwSBA?si=tw9ACxlbdpBuVsnv&amp;t=1045</a></p><p>Datalog: <a href=\"https://docs.racket-lang.org/datalog/\">https://docs.racket-lang.org/datalog/</a></p><p>Tokio: <a href=\"https://tokio.rs/\">https://tokio.rs/</a></p><p>Andrew’s Homepage: <a href=\"http://andrew.nerdnetworks.org/\">http://andrew.nerdnetworks.org/</a></p><p>Andrew’s Blog Post about Tokio: <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/using-rustlangs-async-tokio-runtime-for-cpu-bound-tasks/\">https://thenewstack.io/using-rustlangs-async-tokio-runtime-for-cpu-bound-tasks/</a></p><p>Velox: <a href=\"https://velox-lib.io/\">https://velox-lib.io/</a></p><p>Arroyo: <a href=\"https://www.arroyo.dev/\">https://www.arroyo.dev/</a></p><p>Synnada: <a href=\"https://www.synnada.ai/\">https://www.synnada.ai/</a></p><p>LanceDB: <a href=\"https://lancedb.com/\">https://lancedb.com/</a></p><p>SDF+DBT: <a href=\"https://docs.sdf.com/integrations/dbt/integrating\">https://docs.sdf.com/integrations/dbt/integrating</a></p><p>Support Developer Voices on Patreon: <a href=\"https://patreon.com/DeveloperVoices\">https://patreon.com/DeveloperVoices</a></p><p>Support Developer Voices on YouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@developervoices/join\">https://www.youtube.com/@developervoices/join</a></p><p>Kris on Bluesky: <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/krisajenkins.bsky.social\">https://bsky.app/profile/krisajenkins.bsky.social</a></p><p>Kris on Mastodon: <a href=\"http://mastodon.social/@krisajenkins\">http://mastodon.social/@krisajenkins</a></p><p>Kris on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/krisjenkins/\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/krisjenkins/</a></p>",

Beyond a certain size, everything your software touches becomes part of the wider system. You’re part of the system, your users are part of the system, and every other employee &amp; department &amp; priority eventually forms part of that system. And that can make it incredibly difficult to make changes, or even to understand which changes will actually matter.</p><p>That might be overwhelming, but there's hope. Understanding how systems work and how to improve them is something that can be learnt, and improved at. So in the pursuit of better systems understanding, I’m joined this week by Diana Montalion, coder, architect, and author of Learning Systems Thinking. She takes us through how she sees systems, and how we can get better at discovering and understanding our own systems, as we both chew through some difficult systems we’ve worked on in the hope of figuring out how to do it better next time…</p><p>–</p><p>Learning Systems Thinking (book): https://www.amazon.co.uk/Learning-Systems-Thinking-Essential-Professionals-ebook/dp/B0D9KWZRT2</p><p>Diana’s Website: https://montalion.com/</p><p>Scientific Management (Tailorism): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_management</p><p>Jay Wright Forrester: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Wright_Forrester</p><p>Support Developer Voices on Patreon: https://patreon.com/DeveloperVoices</p><p>Support Developer Voices on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@developervoices/join</p><p>Diana on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dianamontalion/</p><p>Diana on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@dianamontalion</p><p>Kris on BlueSky: https://bsky.app/profile/krisajenkins.bsky.social</p><p>Kris on Mastodon: http://mastodon.social/@krisajenkins</p><p>Kris on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/krisjenkins/</p>",

Writing an actor framework isn’t trivial, but it’s well-trodden ground. The hard part is balancing performance and memory management. When your actors start passing hundreds of thousands of complex messages around, either you need some complex rules about who owns and frees which piece of memory, or you just copy every piece of data and kill your performance. Pony’s solution is a third way - a novel approach to memory management called reference capabilities.</p><p>In this week’s Developer Voices, Sean Allen joins us from the Pony team to explain what reference capabilities are, how Pony uses them in its high-performance actor framework, and how they implement a garbage collector without stop-the-world pauses.

Anything from creating a simple echo sound effect, to building an entire digital instrument based on a 17th-century harpsichord.</p><p>The language in question is Faust, and this week we’re joined by Romain Michon, who works on and teaches Faust, as we look at how it’s designed, what kind of programmers it's for, and how it does the job of turning audio-pipeline definitions into executable code.</p><p>And one of the surprising parts of that compilation strategy is the decision to have it compile to multiple targets, from the expected ones like C and Rust, to the exotic destination of FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays). FPGAs are like reprogrammable circuit boards, and Romain dives into Faust’s attempts to go from a high-level description of an audio program, all the way down to instructions that tell a chip exactly how it should wire itself.</p><p>So rather aptly for a technology podcast, we start this week with what your ear can hear and go all the way down to logic gates and circuit boards…</p><p>–</p><p>Try Faust in the Browser: https://faustide.grame.fr/</p><p>Faust Online Course: https://www.kadenze.com/courses/real-time-audio-signal-processing-in-faust/info</p><p>FPGAs: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array</p><p>VHDL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHDL</p><p>Verilog: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog</p><p>Grame: https://www.grame.fr/</p><p>The (Strawberry Jam) Gramophone: https://www.grame.fr/articles/gramophone</p><p>Gramophone Workshops: https://www.grame.fr/evenements/atelier-gramophones-65ca16b19fec4</p><p><br></p><p>Support Developer Voices on Patreon: https://patreon.com/DeveloperVoices</p><p>Support Developer Voices on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@developervoices/join</p><p><br></p><p>Kris on Mastodon: http://mastodon.social/@krisajenkins</p><p>Kris on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/krisjenkins/</p><p>Kris on Twitter: https://twitter.com/krisajenkins</p>",

Even if you moved as much of the data-management as you can out to 3rd-party services, you’d still have a tonne of work to do weaving together map tiles, routing information, GPS data, points of interest, search and more. And as if that wasn’t enough, you’d probably want that software to work on a whole range of platforms, so you have to build something that works on iOS, Android and more. It’s little wonder that the space is dominated by a few closed-source projects owned by huge companies with near-limitless resources.</p><p>But that doesn’t mean the problem can’t be cracked as an open-source project.

Then we look at the designing for concurrency with typed channels, and handling exceptions by removing them and leaning heavily into ADTs and pattern matching.</p><p>Mixed in with all that is a discussion on the realities of being a programming language developer. How do you figure out how to implement your ideas? What tradeoffs do you make and what kind of programmer do you want to be most useful to?

      "description": "<p>The “big data infrastructure” world is dominated by Java, but the data-analysis world is dominated by Python. So if you need to analyse and process huge amounts of data, chances are you’re in for a less-than-ideal time. The impedance mismatch will probably make your life hard somehow.&nbsp;</p><p>So there are a lot of projects and companies trying to solve that problem. To bridge those two worlds seamlessly, and many of the popular solutions see SQL as the glue. But this week we’re going to look at another solution - ignore Java, treat Kafka as a protocol, and build up all the infrastructure tools you need with a pure Python library. It’s a lot of work, but in theory it would make Python the one language for data storage, analysis and processing, at scale. Tempting, but is it feasible?&nbsp;</p><p>Joining me to discuss the pros, cons, and massive scope of that approach is Tomáš Neubauer. He started off doing real time data analysis for the Maclaren’s F1 team, and is now deep in the Python mines effectively rewriting Kafka Streams in Python. But how? How much work is actually involved in porting those ideas to Python-land, and how do you even get started? And perhaps most fundamental of all - even if you succeed, will that be enough to make the job easy, or will you still have to scale the mountain of teaching people how to use the new tools you’ve built?

      "description": "<p>One of the most promising techniques for software reliability is property testing. The idea that, instead of writing unit tests we describe some property of our code that ought to always be true, then have the computer figure out thousands of unit tests that try to break that rule.</p><p>For example, you might say, “No matter which page you visit on my website, there should always be a login button or a logout button.” Then the test’s job is to try to break that rule, but clicking around until it finds some combination of clicks fails that assertion. Like, maybe it finds the 404 page, and you realise it was missing the website’s normal header.</p><p>At its best, property testing takes far less work than unit testing, but is far more thorough, because it lets us write the rules and has the computer write the examples. The downside is, it often seems theoretical. It can be hard to apply property testing to real-world cases. Let’s fix that.</p><p>We’re joined by Oskar Wickstrom, who’s been building all kinds of different systems and bringing property testing with him wherever he goes. We discuss the basics of property testing, then he goes into the advanced and cunning techniques that go beyond the ordinary into testing databases, webpages and more.

With it, he’s created a spec based on all the things programming languages can agree on, and is building a library that can cross-compile between them. Write a program in Java, and it can be automatically translated to PHP, Python and a great deal more.</p><p>But how far can he take that idea? Is there really enough unity between these languages to build something universal? How do you bridge the divide between manual memory management languages like C and garbage-collected ones like Java?

      "description": "<p>Sometimes, what a programming language makes harder is just as important as what it makes easier. For a simple example, think of GOTO. We’ve been wisely avoiding it for decades because it makes confusing control flow desperately easy. Types and tests are other examples - they’re as much about specifying what shouldn’t work as what should. And perspective is what makes this week’s topic particularly interesting: Roc is a language that’s functional, fast, friendly, and extremely interested in making your life easier by enabling some possibilities and restricting others.</p><p>So this week we’re joined by Richard Feldman, the creator of Roc. He’s been an advocate of the Elm programming language for years, for its tight focus on taking the best bits of Functional Programming to the browser.

But if you ask any business about their stack, things aren’t so clear. They'll probably tell you the key components, and then add a laundry list of extra parts that got glued on later. The reality is, assembling large systems gets complicated. And with more and more options coming out every year, that potential complexity is only growing. These days, a good software developer must also be part researcher, and part explorer.&nbsp;</p><p>So this week we're going to survey the landscape, and head out on the hunt for workable architectures. And joining us to do it is Ben Gamble.

How does that change when we spread those machines out across data centers, situated around the globe? Do we even need to understand how it works, or can we relegate those problems to an off the shelf tool like Zookeeper?</p><p>Joining me this week is Distributed Systems Doctor—Benjamin Bengfort—for a deep dive into consensus algorithms. We start off by discussing how much of “the clustering problem” is your problem, and how much can be handled by a library. We go through many of the constraints and tradeoffs that you need to understand either way. And we eventually reach Benjamin’s surprising message - maybe the time is ripe to roll your own. Should we be writing our own bespoke Raft implementations? And if so, how hard would that be? What guidance can he offer us?&nbsp;</p><p>Somewhere in the recording of this episode, I decided I want to sit down and try to implement a leader election protocol. Maybe you will too. And if not, you’ll at least have a better appreciation for what it takes. Distributed systems used to be rocket science, but they’re becoming deployment as usual.
